# Reusability of Cell Tracking Challenge submissions

This repository serves as as a platform to facilitate researchers to reuse the methods of the [Cell Tracking Challenge](http://celltrackingchallenge.net/) in an easy and direct way. 

It contains Colab Notebooks to reproduce the training and inference of the following contestants, that were presented in the 2021 edition:

- [CALT-US (*)](https://github.com/CellTrackingChallenge/2021-edition-available-colabs/blob/main/Notebooks/CALT-US(*).ipynb)
- [DKFZ-GE](https://github.com/CellTrackingChallenge/2021-edition-available-colabs/blob/main/Notebooks/DKFZ-GE.ipynb)
- [MU-CZ (2*)](https://github.com/CellTrackingChallenge/2021-edition-available-colabs/blob/main/Notebooks/MU-CZ(2*).ipynb)
- [MU-US (4*)](https://github.com/CellTrackingChallenge/2021-edition-available-colabs/blob/main/Notebooks/MU-US(4*).ipynb)
- [PURD-US (*)](https://github.com/CellTrackingChallenge/2021-edition-available-colabs/blob/main/Notebooks/PURD-US(*).ipynb)


Respective links to the contestant's repositories are here, together with the repositories of other teams that already prepared their submission for reusability and created their own Colab notebooks.
