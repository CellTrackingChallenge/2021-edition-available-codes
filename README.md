This repository contains Colab Notebook implementations for the following Cell Tracking Challenge contestants, that were presented in the 2021 edition:


- CALT-US (*)
- DKFZ-GE
- MU-CZ (2*)
- MU-US (4*)
- PURD-US (*)


This intends to serve as a platform to facilitate researchers to reuse these codes in an easy and direct way. 
Links to the correspondent contestant's repositories are here, together with the repositories of other teams that prepared their method for reusability and created their own Colab notebooks.
